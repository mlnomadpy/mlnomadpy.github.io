      <h2>Who am I?</h2>
      <div>
        <p>Jake of all trades, Master of Data Science.</p>
        <p>
          I have always been fascinated by the beauty and power of computers,
          and I have always wanted to understand it, be part of it, and
          innovate. To pursue this interest, I taught myself the basics of
          computer science using online courses and books. Since English is not
          my first language, the road was a bit rough at first, but I persevered
          and eventually obtained my high school degree in mathematics. I then
          went on to earn a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Computer
          Science from the University of Ibn Zohr, Faculty of Science in Agadir.
          Most recently, on July 4, 2022, I obtained a Master of Research Degree
          in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence applied to Computer
          Vision, Signal Processing, and Natural Language Processing. As of
          today, I became a Research Fellow in Rowan University.

      <h2>My Philosophy in a Nutshell?</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          From a young age, I found myself faced with the daunting task of
          making decisions without guidance. I relied on my intuition,
          dedication, and determination to overcome the obstacles in my path. I
          will not deny that I have faced many failures, but I have learned from
          them and ensured that I do not repeat the same mistakes. In the
          process of navigating these challenges, I have developed a passion for
          knowledge and a love of learning that has shaped my current character
          and contributed to my humble achievements. For me, it is not the
          unknown that I fear, but the loss of my desire to seek knowledge. I am
          a lifelong learner, driven by an insatiable thirst for education that
          cannot be quenched. It is this love of learning that sustains me, and
          I will continue to pursue it for as long as I live. I am grateful for
          the hardships that have shaped me, for they have helped me to
          cultivate a deep appreciation for the beauty and complexity of the
          world.

      <h2>Did I tell you.. that I am also a writer</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          When we are unable to access quality mentorship, quality mental health
          education, to better understand how to heal and self-reflect, we must
          turn to alternative methods of self-care. One such method is writing,
          which allows us to express and explore our emotions, thoughts, and
          experiences. By putting our innermost thoughts on paper, we can
          process and make sense of them in a way that may not be possible
          through verbal communication alone. Through the act of writing, we may
          also begin to see patterns and themes emerge in our experiences. This
          can provide us with valuable insights into how certain events and
          circumstances have affected us, and may help us to understand
          ourselves better. Ultimately, writing can be a powerful tool for
          self-discovery and growth.

      <h2>But...How did you get here?</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          One day, I found myself alone and bereft of the people and things that
          had once been important to me. As I looked around, all I had left was
          my own mind and the knowledge and skills I had cultivated. In the face
          of loss and adversity, I clung to the belief that I could shape my own
          destiny, using my complaints about the world as fuel for my curiosity
          and driving me to take action rather than simply holding onto empty
          ideals. Despite the challenges I faced, I remained true to my identity
          and my heritage as I embarked on a journey to fulfill my dream of
          becoming a research scientist from Tamazgha, using computer science to
          make the world a better place.

      <div>
        <p>
          As I navigate the uncertain path of life, I find myself drawn to
          experiences that challenge and inspire me. I am not seeking a specific
          destination, but rather, I am driven by a desire to learn, grow, and
          make a positive impact on the world around me. I do not chase after
          happiness, for I know that it is fleeting and elusive. Instead, I seek
          out the things that I fear the most, for it is in confronting these
          fears that I find true growth and fulfillment. I understand that
          change is the only constant, and I embrace it willingly, knowing that
          it offers endless opportunities for learning and development. As I
          journey through life, I will continue to push myself to new heights,
          ever seeking to improve and evolve. This is the path that I have
          chosen, and I will follow it wherever it may lead.
