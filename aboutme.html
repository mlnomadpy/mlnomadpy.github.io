I have always been fascinated by the beauty and power of computers, and I have always wanted to understand it, be part of it, and innovate. My journey as a researcher, engineer, and nomad has taken me across different realms of knowledge, driven by an insatiable curiosity about how machines can learn and how we can make them more intelligible to humans.</p>
                    <p>I'm the founder and CEO of MLNomads, recognized as a Google Developer Expert in AI/ML, but beyond these titles lies a person constantly navigating the complex landscapes of technology, identity, and purpose. At the core, I'm a builder of bridges between the mathematical foundations of machine learning and their practical applications, between opaque neural networks and interpretable models, between what AI is today and what it could be tomorrow.</p>

                    <p><span class="first-letter">F</span>rom a young age, I found myself faced with the daunting task of making decisions without guidance. I relied on my intuition, dedication, and determination to overcome the obstacles in my path. I will not deny that I have faced many failures, but I have learned from them and ensured that I do not repeat the same mistakes.</p>
                    <p>In the process of navigating these challenges, I have developed a passion for knowledge and a love of learning that has shaped my current character and contributed to my humble achievements. For me, it is not the unknown that I fear, but the loss of my desire to seek knowledge.</p>
                    <p>I am a lifelong learner, driven by an insatiable thirst for education that cannot be quenched. It is this love of learning that sustains me, and I will continue to pursue it for as long as I live. I am grateful for the hardships that have shaped me, for they have helped me to cultivate a deep appreciation for the beauty and complexity of the world.</p>

                    <p><span class="first-letter">W</span>hen we are unable to access quality mentorship, quality mental health education, to better understand how to heal and self-reflect, we must turn to alternative methods of self-care. One such method is writing, which allows us to express and explore our emotions, thoughts, and experiences.</p>
                    <p>By putting our innermost thoughts on paper, we can process and make sense of them in a way that may not be possible through verbal communication alone. Through the act of writing, we may also begin to see patterns and themes emerge in our experiences. This can provide us with valuable insights into how certain events and circumstances have affected us, and may help us to understand ourselves better.</p>
                    <p>Ultimately, writing can be a powerful tool for self-discovery and growth—a window to our own minds and a bridge to understanding others. The same principles guide my approach to research: document, reflect, refine, and share.</p>

                    <p><span class="first-letter">O</span>ne day, I found myself alone and bereft of the people and things that had once been important to me. As I looked around, all I had left was my own mind and the knowledge and skills I had cultivated.</p>
                    <p>In the face of loss and adversity, I clung to the belief that I could shape my own destiny, using my complaints about the world as fuel for my curiosity and driving me to take action rather than simply holding onto empty ideals.</p>
                    <p>Despite the challenges I faced, I remained true to my identity and my heritage as I embarked on a journey to fulfill my dream of becoming a research scientist from Tamazgha, using computer science to make the world a better place. Each algorithm I write, each model I train, each paper I publish is another step on this path—not just to advance the field, but to represent my roots and inspire others like me to pursue their dreams regardless of where they started.</p>

I am not seeking a specific destination, but rather, I am driven by a desire to learn, grow, and make a positive impact on the world around me.</p>
                    <p>I do not chase after happiness, for I know that it is fleeting and elusive. Instead, I seek out the things that I fear the most, for it is in confronting these fears that I find true growth and fulfillment.</p>
                    <p>I understand that change is the only constant, and I embrace it willingly, knowing that it offers endless opportunities for learning and development. As I journey through life, I will continue to push myself to new heights, ever seeking to improve and evolve.</p>
                    <p>This is the path that I have chosen, and I will follow it wherever it may lead. My current focus on developing Neural Matter Networks, refining contrastive learning methods, and creating more transparent AI systems is simply another manifestation of this philosophy—pushing into the unknown, confronting the difficult challenges of our field, and hopefully emerging with something valuable to share.</p>
