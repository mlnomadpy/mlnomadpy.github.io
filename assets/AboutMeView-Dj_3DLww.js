My journey wasn't about following a set path, but about asking "why" and "how"—a relentless need to peel back the layers of the ordinary to find the wonder underneath.</p>
    <p>Today, people might define me by my work, but at my core, I am still that curious kid, a "Nomad" navigating the landscapes of life. I am driven not by a need to conquer, but by a need to understand—to build bridges between where I came from and where I am going, and to find meaning in the spaces between.</p>`,quote:"The titles are just waypoints.

Navigating life without a clear map meant I had to build my own compass. Failures weren't setbacks; they were lessons—essential steps in the long walk of personal growth. I made a pact with myself: never fear the stumble, only the refusal to get back up.</p>
    <p>My philosophy is simple: remain perpetually curious. The moment we think we know enough is the moment we stop growing. I don't fear the unknown; I fear the stagnation of comfort. This hunger for knowledge isn't about status or achievement; it's the fuel that sustains my spirit and gives meaning to the struggle.</p>`,quote:"I don't fear the unknown.

It became more than just a habit; it was a sanctuary. By forcing my thoughts onto paper, I could take the vague, overwhelming anxieties of life and give them shape, understanding them rather than running from them.</p>
    <p>This introspection is how I ground myself. It bridges the gap between what I feel and what I understand, allowing me to transform raw emotion into clarity and purpose.

It was terrifying, but it was also the moment I truly became free. I realized that while I couldn't control the circumstances around me, I had absolute dominion over my response.</p>
    <p>I channeled that energy into moving forward. Every step I took wasn't just a motion—it was an assertion of existence. My journey from the mountains of North Africa to where I stand today is a testament to the power of resilience. I carry my roots with me, proving that where we start does not dictate where we end, and that ambition, when coupled with action, can bridge any divide.</p>`,quote:"Every step is a proof that where you start doesn't dictate where you end."},{id:"path",title:"Path",heading:"Where to Next? —Iskanmagar",backgroundImage:"url('/imgs/bg-path.jpg'), linear-gradient(135deg, #654f2d 0%, #926a36 100%)",content:`<p>I don't have a fixed coordinate for the destination. The spirit of "Iskanmagar" guides me—the belief that the path itself is the destination. I find myself drawn not to the easy comforts, but to the challenges that scare me. I've learned that fear is often just a compass pointing towards where I need to grow next.</p>
    <p>I'm not chasing a static state of happiness, but a dynamic state of evolution.
