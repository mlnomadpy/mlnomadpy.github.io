      <h2>03/12/2024 -- learning spanish and japanese</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          I am a big football fan, specially fc barcelona, and always wanted to
          learn spanish just to visit someday the camp nou and feel the vibes of
          the catalan culture. I am currently learning spanish by myself, and I
          am so excited to be able to speak it fluently one day.
        </p>

          I am also learning japanese, because I am a big fan of the japanese
          culture, and I am planning to visit Japan someday. I tried to learn it
          10 years ago, but I let it go, and now I am back on track.

      <h2>03/12/2024 -- videography, photography, and voiceover</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          I have always been fascinated by the art of videography and
          photography. I love capturing moments and creating visual stories that
          evoke emotions and inspire others. during the past 4 years, I have
          been journaling my life through photography and videography, and one
          project that I am working on is the "Iskanmagar" project, which is a
          visual diary of my life and my journey to self-discovery and growth.
          Where I share my thoughts, experiences, and reflections over the
          lessons I have learned and the challenges I have faced.
