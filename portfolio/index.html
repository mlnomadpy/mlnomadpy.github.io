<p><strong>Overview:</strong></p><p>DeepArganiaWatch is an advanced project that focuses on developing a Patch-Based Deep Learning System for change detection of Argania deforestation using Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery. The project comprises two major components: DeepArganiaDetector, a deep learning segmentation model specifically designed for Argania tree detection, and a change detection module that utilizes DeepArganiaDetector to detect and visualize deforestation changes between two dates specified by the user.</p><p><strong>DeepArganiaDetector:</strong></p><p>The foundation of DeepArganiaWatch lies in the development of DeepArganiaDetector, a deep learning segmentation model. DeepArganiaDetector is trained to take 64x64 pixel patches from Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery, consisting of 13 channels. It performs semantic segmentation to isolate Argania trees by outputting a 64x64 binary mask where &quot;1&quot; denotes the presence of Argania trees and &quot;0&quot; represents the background.</p><center><img src='https://i.imgur.com/Z8ZK0q3.png' style='width:50vw;'></center><p><strong>Training DeepArganiaDetector:</strong></p><p>DeepArganiaDetector is pre-trained on the EuroSAT dataset using a U-Net architecture, producing an output of 64x64x13 for Argania tree, The last layer of the model is then modified to output a 64x64x1 binary mask to perform accurate Argania tree segmentation on our custom dataset. The model is fine-tuned on our dataset to achieve precise segmentation of Argania trees.</p><p><strong>Change Detection Module:</strong></p><p>The Change Detection module is an essential part of DeepArganiaWatch. Users input two dates and a 64x64 region of interest. DeepArganiaDetector is applied separately to the Sentinel-2 imagery from each date, producing two binary masks representing Argania tree presence for each date. The change map is then generated by analyzing the differences between the two binary masks. This process allows us to visualize and quantify deforestation changes in the specified region over time.</p><p><strong>DeepArganiaWatch - Advancing ArganiaWatch:</strong></p><p>DeepArganiaWatch is an improved version of ArganiaWatch, enhancing the accuracy and performance of change detection through the utilization of the DeepArganiaDetector model. By employing deep learning techniques and multispectral Sentinel-2 imagery, DeepArganiaWatch provides a more precise and comprehensive analysis of Argania deforestation, empowering researchers and environmentalists to make informed decisions for conservation and sustainable land management.</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p><p>DeepArganiaWatch represents a significant advancement in change detection of Argania deforestation using multispectral Sentinel-2 imagery. The integration of DeepArganiaDetector, a powerful deep learning segmentation model, allows us to precisely identify Argania trees and visualize changes in the tree cover over time. This project&#39;s impact extends to environmental conservation efforts, providing valuable insights to policymakers and researchers in preserving and safeguarding the Argania tree population. DeepArganiaWatch builds upon the foundation of ArganiaWatch, enabling more accurate detection of deforestation changes and enhancing our understanding of the dynamic landscape of the Argania trees in the Souss region.</p>

<p>Visibility degradation is the cause of many road accidents and air crashes around the globe, it is caused and controlled by multiple key factors that hinder the observer from having a clear vision of what's ahead, playing a crucial role in aviation safety. Alas, researchers and engineers created many tools to measure or restore images suffering from those degradations. This paper compares different image-based deep learning architectures for Atmospheric Visibility Range Classification. A Vision Transformer trained from scratch and three pre-trained Convolution Neural Network (CNN) models were examined and contrasted in terms of accuracy, obtaining a validation accuracy of more than 95 %. Our experiment shows that the different models trained on the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) initial dataset can be used towards building an efficient tool to aid in Flight Control for long-range visibility estimation. Results showed that DenseNet121 was the best-performing model with 99 % training accuracy and 98 % validation accuracy and showed early convergence, while the Vision Transformer kept on showing signs of improving but falling behind only by a bit behind DenseNet121 by the end of the experiment.</p>

<p>Land Cover Change Detection (LCCD) is an important task from the perspective of regional resource monitoring, land use and environmental planning. One of the major concerns for maintaining biodiversity is deforestation. Meanwhile, the recent advances in the field of image processing by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the wide availability of high spatiotemporal resolution satellite imagery provide an unprecedented configuration for the implementation of effective and scalable forest cover change monitoring systems. The objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of two of the most effective deep learning architectures, namely, U-Net and Improved U-Net for the mapping of forest cover to identify deforestation areas between two dates. To this end, two 10m resolution satellite images from the Sentinel-2 satellite covering the Argania forest, a UNESCO Biosphere reserve in the Souss-Massa region in Morocco were used. The implemented methods involve training CNN with two different patch sizes (32–16) in a post-classification framework to compare the classification maps and deduce the change map. The classification accuracy of the two models reached 100% with an advantage to U-Net with an average of Intersection-Over-Union (mIoU) equal to 0.851. The obtained results indicated that Argania forest areas were decreasing over the years, while residential areas and greenhouses were expanding.</p>

<p>In my ML 101 talk, I covered the basics of Machine Learning, aiming to make the topic approachable to everyone in the audience. I started by explaining the core concepts of supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, along with their respective use cases. The audience gained insights into the importance of training data, feature engineering, and model evaluation. I illustrated the machine learning workflow step-by-step, from data collection and preprocessing to model training and deployment. To make the topic more engaging, I introduced the audience to Teachable Machine, a user-friendly web-based tool developed by Google. With Teachable Machine, I demonstrated how even beginners could create a simple solution using machine learning. The audience was thrilled to see how they could train a model with their own data and use it for classification tasks, such as recognizing objects or sounds. This hands-on demonstration helped solidify the concepts and showcased the power of machine learning in solving real-world problems.</p>

<p>During the Brain Tumor Classification with TensorFlow workshop, participants were guided through the process of building a brain tumor classification model using Keras. The workshop covered dataset preprocessing, CNN architecture construction, transfer learning, and model training with various hyperparameters. Participants learned how to evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, Grad-CAM was introduced as a visualization technique to investigate the model's decision-making process. By the end of the workshop, attendees gained valuable hands-on experience in brain tumor classification, enabling them to apply these techniques to other medical imaging and classification tasks in their future endeavors.</p>

<p>In my talk, I shared valuable insights and practical knowledge about remote sensing and machine learning. We started with an introduction to getting started with remote sensing, discussing the significance of remote sensing data and its diverse applications. I explained the process of creating a land cover dataset, covering data collection methods and preprocessing techniques for accurate results.        I then guided the audience through the process of training machine learning models using two different approaches. First, we explored training a pixel-based dataset, understanding the intricacies of handling individual pixels as data points and designing models that operate on this level. This approach is crucial for certain remote sensing tasks, and I highlighted its potential and limitations. Moving on, I demonstrated how to train a machine learning model on a patch-based dataset, with a particular focus on the EuroSat dataset. This approach allows us to leverage spatial context, considering groups of pixels as patches for classification tasks. The audience gained hands-on experience in working with patch-based data and understanding the advantages it brings to remote sensing applications.</p>
